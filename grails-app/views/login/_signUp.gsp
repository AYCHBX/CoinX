  Kraken Terms of Service
</h2>

<p>Last updated: <strong>November 19th, 2013</strong></p>

<p class="uc">PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. BY CLICKING THE "CREATE ACCOUNT" BUTTON OR BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.</p>

<h3>
  Summary of Terms of Service
</h3>

<p>
  This summary of our Terms of Service offers you an overview of the key terms that apply to your use of our website and trading services. While we hope this summary section is helpful, you should read the <a
    href="#complete-tos">complete Terms of Service</a> below since they provide important information about how our services work. Please note that we refer to our online service where you can execute trades as "<strong>Kraken</strong>".
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Our Services</h4>

    <p>Kraken provides you with a simple and convenient way to trade legal tender (such as U.S. dollars and Euros) for digital assets (such as bitcoins and ripples) and vice versa, and to trade one type of digital asset for another type of digital asset. You may also use our Services to purchase and sell digital assets directly from and to us. Our services do not provide users with the ability to trade one form of legal tender for another form of legal tender. Additionally, the range of services available to you will depend in part upon the country or U.S. state from which you access Kraken.</p>
  </li>

  <p>Kraken provides you with a platform that matches your trades with open orders from other users of our services at your direction. Users are not able to predetermine a trade with a particular user or with a particular account. Additionally, an order may be partially filled or may be filled by multiple matching orders.</p>

  <li><h4>Eligibility and Acceptable Use</h4>

    <p>You must meet certain <a
        href="#eligibility">eligibility</a> criteria to use Kraken. For instance, you must be an adult and there are certain locations from which you may not be able to use some or all of Kraken. Additionally, there are certain things you cannot do when using Kraken, such as engage in illegal activities, lie, or do anything that would cause damage to our services or systems. Please see the <a
        href="#aup">acceptable use section</a> for more details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Trading Risks</h4>

    <p>Engaging in trades may be risky, especially if you engage in any <a
        href="#margin-trades">margin trades</a> or use any other sophisticated <a
        href="#trading-options">trading options</a>. Please don't use Kraken or any of the trading options if you do not understand these <a
        href="#risk-disclosure">risks</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Other Important Legal Terms</h4>

    <p>There are important legal terms provided below in the complete Terms of Service, including your <a
        href="#indemnity">indemnification responsibilities</a>, our <a
        href="#limitation-of-liability">limitation of liability</a> and <a
        href="#disclaimer-of-warranties">warranty disclaimers</a>, and your agreement to <a
        href="#arbitration">arbitrate</a> most disputes. Please take the time to read these terms carefully. You can always contact us through support if you have any questions <a
        href="https://support.kraken.com">https://support.kraken.com</a>.</p>

<li><h4 class="uc">Privacy Policy</h4>

  <p>Please refer to our <a
      href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for information about how we collect, use and share your information.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 class="uc">GENERAL OBLIGATIONS</h4>

  <p>This Section 5 applies to: (i) all trades completed via the Services, (ii) your purchase and/or sale of Digital Assets directly from Payward via the Services, and (iii) any transaction in which you load Funds into your Kraken Account from your External Account or push Funds from your Kraken Account into an External Account.</p>
  <ol class="naked">
    <li><span
        class="prefix">5.1</span> <strong>Conditions and Restrictions.</strong> We may, at any time and in our sole discretion, refuse any trade submitted via the Services, impose limits on the trade amount permitted via the Services or impose any other conditions or restrictions upon your use of the Services without prior notice. For example, we may limit the number of open orders that you may establish via the Services or we may restrict trades from certain locations.
    </li>
    <li><span
        class="prefix">5.2</span> <strong>Accuracy of Information.</strong> You must provide any information required when creating a Kraken Account or when prompted by any screen displayed within the Services. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete.
    </li>
    <li><span
        class="prefix">5.3</span> <strong>Cancellations</strong> You may only cancel an order initiated via the Services if such cancellation occurs before Payward executes the transaction. <strong>Once your order has been executed, you may not change, withdraw or cancel your authorization for Payward to complete such transaction.</strong> If an order has been partially filled, you may cancel the unfilled remainder unless the order relates to a market trade. We reserve the right to refuse any cancellation request associated with a market order once you have submitted such order. <strong>In contrast to exchange orders, all trades are irreversible once initiated.</strong>While we may, at our sole discretion, reverse a trade under certain extraordinary conditions, a customer does not have a right to a reversal of a trade.
    </li>
    <li><span
        class="prefix">5.4</span> <strong>Insufficient Funds.</strong> If you have an insufficient amount of Funds in your Kraken Account to complete an order via the Services, we may cancel the entire order or may fulfill a partial order using the amount of Funds currently available in your Kraken Account, less any fees owed to Payward in connection with our execution of the trade (as described in Section 9 below).
    </li>
    <li><span
        class="prefix">5.5</span> <strong>Taxes.</strong> It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the trades you complete via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that Payward is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your trades or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any trades.
    </li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li><h4 class="uc">Kraken ACCOUNT FUNDS</h4>
  <ol class="naked">
    <li><span class="prefix">6.1</span>
      <strong>Funding your Kraken Account.</strong>
      In order to complete an order or trade via the Services (as described in Section 7), you must first load Funds to your Kraken Account using one of the approved External Accounts identified via the Services. You may be required to verify that you control the External Account that you use to load Funds to your Kraken Account. As further described in Section 9, you may be charged fees by the External Account you use to fund your Kraken Account. Payward is not responsible for any External Account fees or for the management and security of any External Account. You are solely responsible for your use of any External Account, and you agree to comply with all terms and conditions applicable to any External Account. The timing associated with a load transaction will depend in part upon the performance of third parties responsible for maintaining the applicable External Account, and Payward makes no guarantee regarding the amount of time it may take to load Funds into your Kraken Account.
    </li>

    <li><span class="prefix">6.2</span>
      <strong>Pushing Funds to an External Account.</strong>
      Provided that the balance of Funds in your Kraken Account is greater than any minimum balance requirements needed to satisfy any of your open positions, you may push any amount of Funds, up to the total amount of Funds in your Kraken Account in excess of such minimum balance requirements, from your Kraken Account to an External Account, less any fees charged by Payward for such transactions (as described in the <a
        href="/help/fees-and-pair-info">Fee Schedule</a> at the time of your request to push Funds to an External Account).
    </li>
    <li><span class="prefix">6.3</span>
      <strong>Load/Push Authorization.</strong>
      When you request that we load Funds into your Kraken Account from your External Account or request that we push Funds to your External Account from your Kraken Account, you authorize Payward to execute such transaction via the Services.
    </li>
    <li><span class="prefix">6.4</span>
      <strong>Rejected Transactions.</strong>
      In some cases, the External Account may reject your Funds or may otherwise be unavailable. You agree that you will not hold Payward liable for any damages resulting from such rejected transactions.
    </li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li><h4 class="uc" id="orders-and-trades">EXCHANGE ORDERS AND TRADES</h4>

  <p>This Section applies only when you use the Services to trade Digital Assets for Legal Tender or vice versa, or to trade Digital Assets for another form of Digital Assets. Payward does not purchase, sell, or exchange any Digital Assets on its own behalf, except for trades conducted on behalf of German users where Payward fulfills each order on a spot basis as the counterparty to both sides of the transaction.</p>
  <ol class="naked">
    <li><span class="prefix">7.1</span>
      <strong>Authorization.</strong>
      When you submit a new order via the Services, you authorize Payward to execute a transaction in accordance with such order on a spot basis and charge you any applicable fees (as described in Section 10 below).
    </li>
    <li><span class="prefix">7.2</span>
      <strong>Independent relationship.</strong>
      You acknowledge and agree that: (a) Payward is not acting as your broker, intermediary, agent, or advisor or in any fiduciary capacity, and (b) no communication or information provided to you by Payward shall be considered or construed as advice.
    </li>
    <li><span class="prefix">7.3</span>
      <strong>Trade confirmation.</strong>
      Once the Services execute your trade, a confirmation will be electronically made available via the Services detailing the particulars of the trade. You acknowledge and agree that the failure of the Services to provide such confirmation shall not prejudice or invalidate the terms of such trade.
    </li>
    <li id="trading-options"><span class="prefix">7.4</span>
      <strong>Trade options.</strong>
      Please refer to the <a
        href="/help/trading-guide">Trading Guide</a>, for information about the terminology used in connection with the trading options made available via the Services. If you do not understand the meaning of any trade option, we strongly encourage you not to utilize any of those options.
    </li>
    <li><span class="prefix">7.5</span>
      <strong>Market rates.</strong>
      If you select a market trade, Payward will attempt, on a commercially reasonable basis, to execute the trade on or close to the prevailing market exchange rate, as defined via the Services. You acknowledge and agree that the exchange rate information made available via our Services may differ from prevailing exchange rates made available via other sources outside of the Services.
    </li>
    <li><span class="prefix">7.6</span>
      <strong>Market volatility.</strong>
      Particularly during periods of high volume, illiquidity, fast movement or volatility in the marketplace for any Digital Assets or Legal Tender, the actual market rate at which a market order or trade is executed may be different from the prevailing rate indicated via the Services at the time of your order or trade. You understand that we are not liable for any such price fluctuations. In the event of a market disruption or Force Majeure event (as defined in Section 24), Payward may do one or more of the following: (a) suspend access to the Services; or (b) prevent you from completing any actions via the Services, including closing any open positions. Following any such event, when trading resumes, you acknowledge that prevailing market rates may differ significantly from the rates available prior to such event.

      <strong>Margin Trades.</strong>
      <ol type="a" class="hmarg50left">
        <li>You agree to maintain in your Kraken Account a sufficient amount of Funds to meet any minimum balance requirements imposed by Payward for users to engage in margin trades. You acknowledge that if you do not have sufficient Funds to meet such minimum balance requirements, that Payward may automatically close some or all of your open positions without notice. Payward may modify such minimum balance requirements from time to time, in its sole discretion. If your margin account balance becomes negative, you agree to pay the amount of Funds owed to Payward within 48 hours. You may not trade on a negative margin account.</li>

      <strong>Trading risks.</strong>
      You acknowledge and agree that you shall access and use the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading Digital Asset pairs and Digital Asset and Legal Tender pairs can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. You should be aware of the following points:
      <ol type="a" class="hmarg50left">
        <li>You may sustain a total loss of the Funds in your Kraken Account, and, in some cases, you may incur losses beyond such Funds. If the market moves against your position, you may be called upon by us to provide a substantial amount of additional margin Funds, on short notice, in order to maintain your position. If you do not provide the required Funds within the time required by us, your position may be liquidated at a loss, and you will be liable for any resulting deficit in your Kraken Account.</li>
        <li>Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example, when the market reaches a daily price fluctuation limit ("limit move"), if there is insufficient liquidity in the market.</li>
        <li>Placing contingent orders, such as "stop-loss" or "stop-limit" orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders.</li>
        <li>All Digital Asset positions involve risk, and a "spread" position may not be less risky than an outright "long" or "short" position.</li>
        <li>The use of leverage can work against you as well as for you and can lead to large losses as well as gains.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="uc">ALL OF THE POINTS NOTED ABOVE APPLY TO ALL DIGITAL ASSET PAIR AND DIGITAL ASSET AND LEGAL TENDER PAIR TRADING. THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT, OF COURSE, DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER ASPECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TRADES.</p>
    </li>
    <li><span class="prefix">8.2</span>
      <strong>Internet transmission risks.</strong>
      You acknowledge that there are risks associated with utilizing an Internet-based trading system including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware, software, and Internet connections. You acknowledge that Payward shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when trading via the Services, howsoever caused.

    </li>
    <li><span class="prefix">10.2</span>
      <strong>Third-Party Fees.</strong>
      In addition to the Fees, your External Account may impose fees in connection with your use of your designated External Account via the Services. Any fees imposed by your External Account provider will not be reflected on the transaction screens containing information regarding applicable Fees. You are solely responsible for paying any fees imposed by an External Account provider.
    </li>
    <li><span class="prefix">10.3</span>
      <strong>Payment of Fees.</strong>
      You authorize us, or our designated payment processor, to charge or deduct your Kraken Account Funds for any applicable Fees owed in connection with trades you complete via the Services.
    </li>
    <li><span class="prefix">10.4</span>
      <strong>Collection-Related Costs.</strong>
      If you fail to pay Fees or any other amounts owed to Payward under these Terms and Payward refers your account(s) to a third party for collection, then Payward will charge you the lesser of an 18% collection fee or the maximum percentage permitted by applicable law, to cover Payward's collection-related costs.

  <ol class="naked">
    <li><span class="prefix">11.1</span>
      <strong>Consent to Electronic Delivery.</strong>
      You agree and consent to receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents, receipts, notices and disclosures (collectively, "<strong>Communications</strong>") that Payward provides in connection with your Kraken Account and/or use of the Payward Services. You agree that Payward may provide these Communications to you by posting them via the Services, by emailing them to you at the email address you provide, and/or by sending an SMS or text message to a mobile phone number that you provide. Your carrier's normal, messaging, data and other rates and fees may apply to any mobile Communications. You should maintain copies of electronic Communications by printing a paper copy or saving an electronic copy. You may also contact us through support <a
        href="https://support.kraken.com">https://support.kraken.com</a> to request additional electronic copies of Communications or, for a fee, paper copies of Communications (as described below).
    </li>
    <li><span class="prefix">11.2</span>
      <strong>Hardware and Software Requirements.</strong>
      In order to access and retain electronic Communications, you will need a computer with an Internet connection that has a current web browser with cookies enabled and 128-bit encryption. You will also need to have a valid email address on file with Payward and have sufficient storage space to save past Communications or an installed printer to print them.
    </li>
    <li><span class="prefix">11.3</span>
      <strong>Withdrawal of Consent.</strong>
      You may withdraw your consent to receive electronic Communications by sending a withdrawal notice to support <a

    </li>
    <li><span class="prefix">11.4</span>
      <strong>Requesting Paper Copies.</strong>
      If, after you consent to receive Communications electronically, you would like a paper copy of a Communication we previously sent you, you may request a copy within 30 days after the date we provided the Communication to you by contacting support <a
        href="https://support.kraken.com">https://support.kraken.com</a>. In order for us to send paper copies to you, you must have a current street address on file with Payward. Please note that Kraken operates exclusively online and it is very burdensome for us to produce paper copies of Communications. Therefore, if you request paper copies, you understand and agree that Payward may charge you a processing fee, in the amount described in the <a
        href="/help/fees-and-pair-info">Fee Schedule</a>, for each page of Communication requested.
    </li>
    <li><span class="prefix">11.5</span>
      <strong>Updating Contact Information.</strong>
      It is your responsibility to keep your email address and/or mobile phone number on file with Payward up to date so that Payward can communicate with you electronically. You understand and agree that if Payward sends you an electronic Communication but you do not receive it because your email address or mobile phone number on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic Communications, Payward will be deemed to have provided the Communication to you. Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add Payward to your email address book so that you will be able to receive the Communications we send to you.&nbsp;You can update your email address, mobile phone number or street address at any time by logging into your Kraken Account or by sending such information to support <a
        href="https://support.kraken.com">https://support.kraken.com</a>. If your email address or mobile phone number becomes invalid such that electronic Communications sent to you by Payward are returned, Payward may deem your account to be inactive, and you may not be able to complete any transaction via our Services until we receive a valid, working email address or mobile phone number from you.

<h2 id="margin-disclosure-statement">Margin Disclosure Statement</h2>

<p>We are furnishing this document to you to provide some basic facts about purchasing digital assets or legal tender on margin, and to alert you to the risks involved with trading assets in a margin account. Before trading assets in a margin account, you should carefully review this margin disclosure statement. Please contact us through support <a
    href="https://support.kraken.com">https://support.kraken.com</a> regarding any questions or concerns you may have with your margin accounts.
</p>

<p>When you purchase digital assets for legal tender or vice versa, you may pay in full or you may borrow part of the purchase price from us. If you choose to borrow funds from us, you will open a margin account. The assets purchased are our collateral for the loan to you. If the assets in your account declines in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan, and, as a result, we can take action, such as issue a margin call and/or sell assets in your account, in order to maintain the required equity in the account.</p>

<p>It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading assets on margin. These risks include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account.</strong> A decline in the value of assets that are purchased or sold on margin may require you to provide additional funds to us to avoid the forced sale of assets in your account(s).
  </li>
  <li><strong>We can force the sale of assets in your account.</strong> If the equity in your account falls below our maintenance margin requirements, we can sell assets in your account to cover the margin deficiency. You also will be responsible for any shortfall in the account after such a sale.
  </li>
  <li><strong>We can sell your assets without contacting you.</strong> Customers may mistakenly believe that we must contact them for a margin call to be valid, and that we cannot liquidate assets in their accounts to meet the call unless we have contacted them first. This is not the case. We will attempt to notify you of margin calls, but we are not required to do so. However, even if we have contacted you and provided a specific date by which you can meet a margin call, we can still take necessary steps to protect our financial interests, including immediately selling assets without notice to you.
  </li>
  <li><strong>We can increase maintenance margin requirements at any time and are not required to provide you with advance written notice.</strong> These maintenance margin requirements often take effect immediately and may result in the issuance of a maintenance margin call. Your failure to satisfy the call may cause us to liquidate or sell assets in your account(s). We are not responsible to delays in the release of funds intended to satisfy the call, including but not limited to internal holds on funds exceeding verification limits, delays in the transfer of funds from external accounts maintained by third party financial institutions, and failure of proper routing of funds through financial networks. The funds won't count towards their maintenance requirements until the funds are released.
  </li>
  <li><strong>You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call.</strong> While an extension of time to meet margin requirements may be available to you under certain conditions, a customer does not have a right to the extension.
  </li>
</ul>
